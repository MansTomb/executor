/**
 * The app Workers one workerd process keeps loaded. The pinned workerd never unloads a named
 * Worker Loader entry by itself, so without a bound every app and account selection a process ever
 * called stays resident, and memory grows with them. A host that owns its workerd process gives
 * its runner this residency: it counts the calls in flight in each named Worker and, whenever more
 * Workers are loaded than the configured limit, unloads the least recently used idle ones. A Worker
 * with a call in flight, including an unfinished release, a paused elicitation or a running
 * workflow, is never unloaded, so no work is lost (a release that outlives its limit keeps its
 * hold until it settles); while every loaded Worker is busy the limit is
 * exceeded until calls finish. The next call of an unloaded Worker cold-starts it from its build.
 *
 * The state lives in the runner's own isolate, which workerd keeps for the life of the process.
 * Cloud has no residency: Cloudflare unloads its Workers itself.
